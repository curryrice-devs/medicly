  "injuryType": "Shoulder impingement",
  "bodyPart": "Shoulder",
  "summary": "Patient demonstrates classic signs of rotator cuff impingement with compensatory movement patterns. Limited shoulder abduction with painful arc present between 60-120°. Substitution patterns include trunk lateral lean and early scapular elevation. External rotation weakness noted.",
  "reasoning": "The painful arc during abduction, combined with compensatory trunk lean and early scapular elevation, strongly suggests subacromial impingement. The inability to maintain proper scapulohumeral rhythm and the visible discomfort during mid-range abduction are characteristic of rotator cuff involvement.",
